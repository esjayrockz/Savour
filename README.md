Savour is a web application that allows users to know information regarding a specific dish in a particular restaurant. Users will be able to search for dishes and know how good a specific dish in a particular restaurant is and also other relevant information of the dish like cuisine and category. A restaurant will be able to add dishes present in their menu and also specific dish information to this application catalog. These dishes can then later be rated and reviewed by foodies. There is a admin user in the backend who can grant specific privileges to specific users and restaurants. The project makes use of technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, MySql, Ruby on Rails. We have used MySql as our database to store all the information of users, dishes and the ratings/reviews of users. The main objective of this application is to make sure that users choose the best dishes when they visit a restaurant.
